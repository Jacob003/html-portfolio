<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>. My name us Jacob Mukamba I am a 32-year-old electrical engineer with a strong passion for problem-solving and building things that make a difference. 
  Recently, I’ve felt called to transition into the world of software development, 
  where I can apply my technical background and creativity to design solutions that are impactful, practical, and forward-looking. </p>

<p>At the heart of everything I do is my faith in Jesus. My relationship with Him shapes my values, guides my decisions, and inspires me to grow not just in my career, but also as a husband, father, and friend. 
  I believe that faith and work go hand in hand, and I strive to live out my calling with excellence and integrity.</p>

<p>Outside of work and learning, I am blessed with a wonderful wife and daughter who bring joy and meaning to my life.
   Music is another passion of mine—I love playing guitar and using it as a way to both relax and express creativity. 
  Together, faith, family, and music keep me grounded while I pursue new opportunities in the software field.</p>
